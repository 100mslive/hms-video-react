# IMPORTANT: Deprecation Notice
  
Note that this library is on path of eventual deprecation, if you're starting a new project please use [@100mslive/react-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@100mslive/react-sdk), our [quickstart guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/guides/react-quickstart) should help you in getting up quickly. For already existing projects, if you're not using any UI components and only using the hooks, you can simply replace all occurence of "@100mslive/hms-video-react" with "@100mslive/react-sdk" after installing the latter.
We're also actively working on a UI package ["@100mslive/react-ui"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@100mslive/react-ui), currently in alpha for helping with headless and styled components.

This library currently provides is composed of two pieces - 
  
1. hooks which interface with our sdk for easily using with functional components. More details [here](https://docs.100ms.live/javascript/v2/features/integration#installing-our-libraries).
2. UI components for common use cases - video tile, preview etc. Note that these components are on path of deprecation and we don't recommend their use as a library. We're actively working on a new UI components library which will provide improved flexibility and ease of use.
