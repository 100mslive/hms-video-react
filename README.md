Create beautfiful custom applications using 100ms' React SDK.
  
This library currently provides ic composed of two pieces - 
  
1. hooks which interface with our sdk for easily using with functional components. More details [here](https://docs.100ms.live/javascript/v2/features/integration#installing-our-libraries).
2. UI components for common use cases - video tile, preview etc. Note that these components are on path of deprecation and we don't recommend their use as a library. There is no active development going on and we're working on a different UI components library which will provide improved flexibility and ease of use. You can still refer to our implementation of the components to design your own.

Install using

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/hms-video-react@latest
```
